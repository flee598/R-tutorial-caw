## Overview

An introduction to R for Cawthron ECRs.

-   Session 1: an introduction to R, RStudio and the `tidyverse`
-   Session 2: an introduction to creating figures with `ggplot2`
-   Session 3: getting set up with GitHub and RStudio
-   Session 4: TBC

These sessions are not based on a natural progression, rather they are topics that have been requested. If there is a desire to have workshops that go into more depth or cover other topics we can do that too.

## Set up

Bring your laptop. Stuff to install before the first session:

-   [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
-   [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Also install the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org) meta-package (collection of multiple packages), this can be done by running `install.packages("tidyverse")`.
